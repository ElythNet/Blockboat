# Blockboat
Blockchain project experience 1 by Alexis GOMES for the Hof University of Applied Sciences

. Within the blockboat project, we will decide for a feasible combination of desired properties and implement a prototype showing how software licenses can be issued, sold, resold and traced in an IoT scenario.

You task is it, to use Hyperledger Fabric or Burrow to

-	Build a demo of a permissioned Blockchain that runs on at least 4 nodes (Docker container) and is able to transfer tokens from one account (address) to another. 

-	Modify the demo, so that it â€¦

o	distinguishes between tokens that represent software licenses and coins.

o	is able to start a smart contract with the amount of coins to transfer and the license to return that guarantees that the license is transferred once the money is sent.

o	it uses a Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus model instead of proof of work

-	Develop a client that is able to check in the blockchain, whether a certain license is currently in the wallet with a certain blockchain address
